# PHP MVC Framework

## Prologue

I started working with Laravel back when version 3 was released, since then I became proficient and expert in using Laravel as a tool but I never went deep down the rabbit hole to understand how every moving parts work together that's why I built PHP-MVC framework. This framework built from scratch based on Laravel ideas of clean code. The goal is to have a clear and deep understanding on what it takes to build something like Laravel and how the MVC pattern works under the hood.

## Standards

This project doesn't aim to be anything more than an educational excercise the only requirement right now is PHP 8.

## Can I use it?

Sure, you can do whatever you like with it, bear in mind this is not a production ready framework use it at your own risks. It's licensed under the "Unlicensed" license for a reason, I don't provide "production" support whatsoever and if you are willing to contribute that's fine but don't expect support out of it
