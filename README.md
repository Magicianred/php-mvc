# PHP MVC Framework

PHP MVC framework built from scratch based on Laravel ideas of clean code. This is an educational project only nothing is meant to be used in production whatsoever.

I've several years of experience with Laravel and I wanted to try to build my own framework just for fun and learning

# Can I use it?

Sure, you can do whatever you like with it, bear in mind this is not a production ready framework use it at your own risks
